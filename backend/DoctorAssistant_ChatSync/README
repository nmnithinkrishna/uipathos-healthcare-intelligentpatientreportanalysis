This UiPath Studio project aims to be an example as well as a template for those who are looking to implement a real time communication between UiPath Apps and UiPath automations. This zip file contains the UiPath Studio project, the .uiapp file to be deployed on your organization tenant and this README file that explains you how to use this feature and this example.

	- invokedWorkflows\example1.xamle - the xaml that will be invoked by the app.
You will find more information about how things work on each of the XAML files. You can use this as a template for future projects.
